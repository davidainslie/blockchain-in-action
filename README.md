# Smart Contracts and Dapps with Solidity

Following the book `Blockchain in Action`.

Dapp development will have the following essentials:

- For every Dapp project, a `<project>-app` module for the web application and a `<project>-contract` module for smart contracts
- A web server and a package manager (`Node.js` and the `Node Package Manager` [npm])
- A blockchain provider (such as `Ganache`) called `web3 provider`
- A development tool, the `Truffle` suite (IDE) that provides an integrated environment to deploy and test a Dapp
- Account management using the `MetaMask` browser plugin
